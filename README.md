numpy (imported as np): NumPy is a library for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for working with arrays and matrices, making it useful for various mathematical and scientific tasks.
pandas (imported as pd): Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It offers data structures like DataFrames and Series, which are essential for handling and analyzing structured data.
seaborn (imported as sns): Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
matplotlib.pyplot (imported as plt): Matplotlib is a widely used data visualization library in Python. The pyplot module provides functions for creating various types of plots and charts.
sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder: This class from Scikit-Learn is used for encoding categorical labels as numeric values. It's commonly used when dealing with machine learning models that require numeric input.
sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: Min-max scaling is a data preprocessing technique that scales features to a specified range (usually between 0 and 1). This is often used to normalize numerical data.
sklearn.cluster.KMeans: The K-means clustering algorithm is implemented in Scikit-Learn through this class. It's used for unsupervised clustering of data into K clusters based on similarity.
sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score: The silhouette score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of clusters produced by a clustering algorithm like K-means. Higher silhouette scores indicate better-defined clusters.
warnings: The warnings module is used to control how warning messages are displayed. In your code snippet, it seems like you're not currently using it for any specific purpose.
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore"): This line disables warning messages to prevent them from being displayed during the execution of your code.
dfRaw=pd.read_csv('data.csv'): You've read the 'data.csv' file into a DataFrame called dfRaw. This assumes that the CSV file is in the same directory as your Python script.
dfRaw.head(): This line displays the first few rows of the DataFrame dfRaw to give you an initial look at the data.
dfRaw.info(): The info() method provides information about the DataFrame, including the number of non-null values in each column and the data types of the columns.
dfRaw.isnull().sum(): This line calculates the sum of null values (missing values) in each column of the DataFrame. It helps identify columns with missing data.
dfRaw['date'] = pd.to_datetime(dfRaw['date'], format='%Y-%m-%d'): You've converted the 'date' column to a datetime format assuming that the date is in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. This will allow you to work with dates more easily.
dfRaw['month'] = dfRaw['date'].dt.month: You've extracted the month from the 'date' column and created a new 'month' column in your DataFrame.
The following code block appears to create a new list tempList based on the 'month' values in your DataFrame. It assigns values 1, 2, 3, or 4 to each month based on which quarter it belongs to:
Months 1 to 3 are assigned the value 1 (Q1).
Months 4 to 6 are assigned the value 2 (Q2).
Months 7 to 9 are assigned the value 3 (Q3).
Months 10 to 12 are assigned the value 4 (Q4).
dfRaw['quarter'] = tempList: You've created a new column 'quarter' in your DataFrame and assigned the values from the previously created tempList. This column indicates the quarter of the year to which each date belongs (Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4).
dfRaw['year'] = dfRaw['date'].dt.year: You've extracted the year from the 'date' column and created a new 'year' column in your DataFrame.
dfRaw['time'] = pd.to_datetime(dfRaw['time'], format='%H:%M:%S'): You've converted the 'time' column to a datetime format, assuming the time is in the 'HH:MM:SS' format.
dfRaw['hours'] = dfRaw['time'].dt.hour: You've extracted the hour component from the 'time' column and created a new 'hours' column in your DataFrame.
dfRaw['minutes'] = dfRaw['time'].dt.minute: You've extracted the minute component from the 'time' column and created a new 'minutes' column in your DataFrame.
The following code block assigns a day period label based on the 'hours' column. It creates a new 'dayPeriod' column:
Hours between 0 and 3 are labeled as 'Night.'
Hours between 3 and 6 are labeled as 'Dawn.'
Hours between 6 and 12 are labeled as 'Morning.'
Hours between 12 and 18 are labeled as 'Afternoon.'
Hours between 18 and 24 are labeled as 'Evening.'
Another code block assigns an 'earthquakeCategory' label based on the 'magnitude' column. It creates a new 'earthquakeCategory' column:
Magnitude values less than 3 are labeled as 'Micro.'
Magnitude values between 3 and 4 are labeled as 'Minor.'
Magnitude values between 4 and 5 are labeled as 'Light.'
Magnitude values between 5 and 6 are labeled as 'Moderate.'
Magnitude values between 6 and 7 are labeled as 'Strong.'
Magnitude values between 7 and 8 are labeled as 'Major.'
Magnitude values greater than or equal to 8 are labeled as 'Great.'
Season Assignment:
I created a new 'season' column based on the 'month' column. It assigns the value 'Dry' if the month falls between April and October (inclusive), and 'Rainy' otherwise. This categorizes the months into dry and rainy seasons.
Depth Category Assignment:
I created a new 'depthCategory' column based on the 'depth' column. It assigns labels 'Shallow,' 'Intermediate,' or 'Deep' to earthquakes based on their depth values.
DataFrame Subsetting:
I created a new DataFrame called df by selecting specific columns from dfRaw. It includes columns related to year, quarter, month, location, earthquake characteristics, and the newly created 'season' and 'depthCategory' columns.
I filtered the data to include only records where the 'year' is greater than 2010 and less than 2021.
You've reset the index of the DataFrame.
Data Visualization:
I created two sets of subplots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize numerical features.
In the first set of subplots, you're using boxplots to visualize the distribution of numerical features. Each subplot corresponds to a different numerical feature.
In the second set of subplots, you're using histograms (histplot) to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
The numerical features you're visualizing include 'year,' 'quarter,' 'month,' 'latitude,' 'longitude,' 'depth,' and 'magnitude.'
The purpose of these visualizations is to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of your data. Boxplots show summary statistics, such as median, quartiles, and potential outliers, while histograms provide a more detailed view of data distribution.
Countplot for Categorical Features:
I create countplots to visualize the distribution of each categorical feature (dayPeriod, earthquakeCategory, season, depthCategory) using sns.countplot.
Each subplot represents one categorical feature.
Countplot Grid for Interactions Between Categorical Features:
I create a grid of countplots to visualize interactions between pairs of categorical features (dayPeriod, earthquakeCategory, season, depthCategory) using sns.countplot.
The hue parameter is used to distinguish between categories within each feature, and you use plt.legend to add a legend to the plots.
Countplots Over Time:
I create countplots to visualize the distribution of each categorical feature (dayPeriod, earthquakeCategory, season, depthCategory, quarter) over time, with 'year' on the x-axis.
This set of plots shows how the distribution of these categorical features changes over different years.
Boxplots for Categorical Features vs. Magnitude:
I create boxplots to visualize the relationship between categorical features (dayPeriod, season, depthCategory, quarter) and the 'magnitude' column.
The hue parameter is used to distinguish between categories within each feature, and plt.legend adds legends to the plots.
These visualizations are helpful for understanding the relationships and distributions within your data. You can gain insights into how categorical features are distributed and how they may relate to earthquake magnitudes or other variables.K-Means Clustering on Latitude and Longitude:
I scaled the 'longitude' and 'latitude' columns using Min-Max scaling.
I performed K-means clustering with n_clusters=3 on the scaled 'longitude' and 'latitude.'
The cluster labels are assigned to the 'area' column in your DataFrame.
I created a scatterplot to visualize the clusters on a map with 'latitude' on the y-axis and 'longitude' on the x-axis, using different colors for each cluster.
Countplot for Clusters with Categorical Features:
I created countplots to visualize the distribution of categorical features (quarter, dayPeriod, earthquakeCategory, season, depthCategory) within each cluster.
This helps you understand how categorical features are distributed across the clusters.
Data Transformation and K-Means Clustering on Categorical Features:
I selected a subset of columns containing categorical features and the 'area' cluster label and stored them in a new DataFrame (tempDf).
I applied Label Encoding to convert categorical features to numerical values.
I scaled the features in tempDf using Min-Max scaling.
I performed K-means clustering with n_clusters=9 on the scaled categorical features.
The cluster labels are assigned to the 'cluster1_9' column in your main DataFrame.
Scatterplot of Clusters Based on Latitude and Longitude:
I created a scatterplot to visualize the clusters based on 'latitude' and 'longitude' after the second round of clustering.
Summary Statistics for Clusters:
I calculated and displayed summary statistics for each cluster, including counts, percentages, and quartiles for 'depth' and 'magnitude.'
This provides insights into the characteristics of each cluster.
Countplot for Clusters from the Second Round of Clustering:
I created a countplot to visualize the distribution of the clusters created in the second round of clustering (cluster2_3) within your data.
These analyses and visualizations aim to help you understand how earthquakes are grouped into clusters based on their geographical and categorical characteristics. The clustering allows you to identify patterns and differences among earthquake events.
